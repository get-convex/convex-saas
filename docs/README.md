# Getting Started

1. [Copy this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=convex-saas&template_owner=erquhart)
2. Clone the repo
3. Install dependencies and set up a new Convex project:

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install

# set up a new Convex project
npx convex dev --configure=new --once

# set up Convex Auth
npx @convex-dev/auth
```

# Environment

## Email

[Resend](https://resend.com/) is a simple and easy-to-use email service for developers.

1. Get your API Key by visiting the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys).
2. Add to your Convex dev deployment:
   ```sh
   npx convex env set RESEND_API_KEY re_...
   ```

## Stripe

In order to use Stripe Subscriptions and seed our database, we'll require to get the secret keys from our Stripe Dashboard.

1. Create a [Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login) or use an existing one.
2. Set to test mode if desired.
3. Visit the [API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) section and copy `Secret` key.
4. Add to your Convex dev deployment:

   ```

## Stripe Webhook

Stripe sends webhook events when your users update or delete their subscriptions.

1. Install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
2. Run the local webhook server:

```sh
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5173/api/webhook
```

4. After running the first time, you may be prompted to authenticate. If so, after
   authenticating, rerun the command.
5. The CLI will print a webhook secret key and begin listening for events.
6. Add the webhook secret key to your Convex dev deployment:
   ```sh
   npx convex env set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET whsec_...
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This command should be running in your console during local development if testing or handling Stripe Events.
